# Cult Classics: The Video Store as Cultural Artifact


## _Memento_ (2000): The Collection

{% include feature/marginnote-image.html id="memento" img="/objects/memento.jpg" title="Movie poster for Memento" link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CV41hoyS8A" %}

At Howard Hughes, customers could {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text='"browse and wonder"' objectid="mainstreet015" start="1306" %} through their curated 30,000-title collection. 

For reference: {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="you would need to subscribe to at least 11 streaming services" objectid="mainstreet018" start="3580" %} to replicate their catalog, and even then, you’d still be missing some gems.

Whether you were drawn to the new releases, the robust foreign film section, or classic early cinema, {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="everyone could get something they liked." objectid="mainstreet019" start="401" %}

If you couldn’t find what you were looking for, manager [Beau Newsome]({{ '/items/mainstreet003.html' | relative_url }}) would add it to his infamous list and do his best to get it for you: 

{% include feature/youtube-clip-quote.html text="My tastes were fairly out there, and even when it was back in the appliance shop they tried to accommodate us." objectid="mainstreet012" start="326" source="Eric Nilsson, Customer" %}

Customers like [Forrest Ellsworth]({{ '/items/mainstreet025.html' | relative_url }}) would capitalize on the store’s five-movie rental deal to expand his knowledge of film and explore the catalog. In addition to three movies chosen intentionally, he would pick one that he had heard about, and one random selection. This is how he discovered some of his favorite movies, including [*Come and See*  (1985)](https://www.criterion.com/films/28895-come-and-see){:target='_blank'}, [*McCabe & Mrs. Miller* (1971)](https://www.criterion.com/films/28712-mccabe-mrs-miller){:target='_blank'}, and [*Magnolia* (1999)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnamcFv_N9Q){:target='_blank'}. For an especially transcendent experience, watch that last one with {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="Chicken McNuggets." objectid="mainstreet024" %}

The collection was also a way for customers to learn about different cinematic traditions across time and place. For [Lily Pannkuk]({{ '/items/mainstreet015.html' | relative_url }}), the foreign film section offered a chance to explore the affective differences between German and French films. His teen obsession with [Fritz Lang](https://www.criterion.com/search#stq=fritz+lang){:target='_blank'} gave him insight into the transition from silent films to talkies. 

For others, it helped hone their personal cinematic palate. [Courtney Berge]({{ '/items/mainstreet034.html' | relative_url }}) describes how early on, "It was like a time of discovery, and I was figuring out my own tastes and learning about what I liked in film."

{% include feature/youtube-embed.html youtubeid="-3OomYpHSI4" start="3509" end="3529" %}

Counterintuitively, some of the collection’s worth might have lay in its _bad_ movies:

{% include feature/youtube-clip-quote.html text="I thought some of our most valuable movies were the worst movies, the movies that nobody would ever think to preserve because they’re not going to be streaming on Netflix." objectid="mainstreet026" start="4084" source="Monique Lillard, Customer & Board Member" %}

For a taste, check out [*Werewolves on Wheels* (1971)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDDGbSJN0o){:target='_blank'}{% include feature/marginnote-image.html img="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/73/Werewolvesonwheels.jpg" caption="_Werewolves on Wheels_" %} and [*Vampiyaz: Brothaz in Blood* (2004).](https://vimeo.com/504606578){:target='_blank'}{% include feature/marginnote-image.html img="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2I2MjNiN2UtZWJlZC00ODA2LWIyNDQtNzY1MmFiODMxZDE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg" caption="_Vampiyaz: Brothaz in Blood_" %}

In thinking this way about the collection, it becomes not just a library, but an archive. {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="Not every film makes the transition from VHS to DVD" objectid="mainstreet007" start="1118" %}, nor from DVD to streaming, and without places to make these artifacts available, they’re lost to history. 

[Scarecrow Video](https://scarecrowvideo.org/){:target='_blank'} in Seattle has {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="a treasure trove of rare media" objectid="mainstreet008" start="1008" %}, including two VHS copies of [*Eraserhead* (1977)](https://www.criterion.com/films/28382-eraserhead){:target='_blank'} and Disney’s racist *Song of the South* (1946) [which Disney has tried](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/19/song-of-the-south-the-difficult-legacy-of-disneys-most-shocking-movie){:target='_blank'} to [hide from American audiences](https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/how-disney-tried-and-failed-to-remove-song-of-the-south-from-history){:target='_blank'} despite profiting from it elsewhere. 

Scarecrow has 88 titles that are not even held by the Library of Congress and may have the {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="only known copy of 44 of them" objectid="mainstreet016" start="1199" %}. As viewers, it’s important we’re not limited to those films that have achieved mass cultural appeal or support a corporate-driven revisionist history. 

[Kate Barr]({{ '/items/mainstreet016.html' | relative_url }}), the current Executive Director at Scarecrow Video, emphasizes what sets a video rental store’s collection apart from a streaming platform: its titles {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="were carefully curated by film lovers over time" objectid="mainstreet016" start="4316" %}

Ultimately, Kate says, "the size isn’t as important as the curation."

## *The Thing* (1982): A Tangible Experience



If the internet has ushered us into the age of digital, video rental stores belong to a time of tangibility. Stepping over the door’s threshold, you entered a place whose sole purpose was to house movies, more movies than you could imagine or ever expect to watch. As customer [Luke Gresback]({{ '/items/mainstreet020.html' | relative_url }}) remembers, “When I was really short and tiny the racks would go above my head, I was swimming in movies, literally." 

{% include feature/youtube-embed.html youtubeid="7k2opPh6ufc" start="94" end="150" %}


 Like being {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="in a used bookstore" objectid="mainstreet005" start="196" %}, there’s something magical about being surrounded by stories that are ready to transport you to another country, world, or life, should you decide to check them out.

Depending on your generation, the shelves were stocked predominantly with VHS tapes,{% include feature/marginnote-image.html img="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/VHS-Video-Tape-Top-Flat.jpg/2560px-VHS-Video-Tape-Top-Flat.jpg" caption="This is a VHS tape." title="VHS tape" %} DVDs,{% include feature/marginnote-image.html img="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Oxygen480-devices-media-optical-dvd.svg/1200px-Oxygen480-devices-media-optical-dvd.svg.png" caption="This is a DVD." title="DVD disc" %} or a combination. If there was VHS in the room, {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="you could likely smell it" objectid="mainstreet021" start="170" %}—the tapes gave off a plasticky, petroleum-laced odor that was especially pungent when recently ejected from a VCR.{% include feature/marginnote-image.html img="https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/07/21/vcr_9752-edit_wide-8a2db6a89eb4efc20bfa259a4fb01d888915ed28.jpg?s=1400" caption="A VHS being ejected from a VCR." title="" %} 
DVDs were sleeker, trading the boxy VHS for compact packaging and a flat, shiny disc. 

While DVDs offered improved visuals and sound, tapes were more durable. Barring their tendency to melt if left {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="too long in a hot car" objectid="mainstreet003" start="745" %}, their malfunctions were few and generally easy to fix:

{% include feature/youtube-clip-quote.html text="We had a box of old VHS. It’s like old car parts, basically. Something breaks on a VHS tape, you just dig through the box, find it, fix it, and you can splice the actual film or tape or whatever. You think you’re cutting out a huge part of the movie, but you’re really only cutting like half a second or something." objectid="mainstreet003" start="655" source="Beau Newsome, Manager" %}

That being said, tape _would_ deteriorate if played repeatedly, as one group of girls learned after watching some pivotal scenes from [*Dirty Dancing*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIcmQNy9FsM){:target='_blank'} a few too many times...

{% include feature/youtube-embed.html youtubeid="Ecy-KIISucc" start="2259" end="2300" %}

DVDs had a habit of getting scratched, resulting in skipping and customer complaints. Employees used a DVD resurfacer to try to extend the life of the discs, but with limited success.

They weren’t all bad, though: DVDs introduced the ability to skip scenes, saving us from the boredom of manually fast-forwarding; they included special features and commentaries that deepened our understandings of the films; they didn’t need to be rewound before returning. 

Crucially, their smaller size made room for more inventory. [Beau Newsome]({{ '/items/mainstreet003.html' | relative_url }}) explains, "One thing about a video store it’s not like buying a piece of fruit and then you replace it with another piece of fruit. It’s just a collection that just grows and grows and grows and grows and grows, so {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="you run out of room really quickly." objectid="mainstreet003" start="1286" %}

Given that movies are always being released, Howard Hughes had to balance acquiring new releases (both blockbusters and more obscure titles) with maintaining space for their rapidly expanding collection. 

After moving from the store’s large location on 5<sup>th</sup> Street to its final (smaller) home on Main Street, space became a more pressing issue. Employees put the VHS in storage and turned the movies so that their spines faced out rather than the covers, which {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="disappointed customers who liked to browse using the cover images." objectid="mainstreet034" start="2699" %}

Even as foot traffic diminished, a core group of customers kept up with their rental ritual: stopping in to wander the aisles, {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="reading the back of the boxes," objectid="mainstreet004" start="224" %} taking the box to the front desk where it’s swapped for a jewel case with *hopefully* the correct movie, and then out the door, eager to get home and watch.

## *Clerks* (1994): The Employees 

{% include feature/marginnote-image.html id="clerks" img="/objects/clerks.jpg" title="Movie poster for Clerks" link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGT3n1Emi8U"%}


Howard Hughes Video Store never had to advertise that they were hiring: They received a steady stream of applications from local hopefuls who hoped to join the ranks of the cool clerks behind the counter. For those that made it, the job was in turns an education and an opportunity to display their expansive knowledge of film. 

{% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="Reportedly, dusting was often left off the list." objectid="mainstreet014" start="3653" %}

For [Beau Newsome]({{ '/items/mainstreet003.html' | relative_url }}), working at Howard Hughes was "its own kind of film school."

His taste diversified as he received recommendations from his coworkers, sending him deeper into {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="award winners, art house cinema, and underground classics." objectid="mainstreet003" start="487" %}


Many of the employees were inspired by [Quentin Tarantino](https://www.vulture.com/2015/08/best-quentin-tarantino-movies-ranked.html ){:target='_blank'} who famously worked at a video store before finding success in the movie industry.[Connor O’Rourke]({{ '/items/mainstreet032.html' | relative_url }}) grew up dreaming about someday working at a video store, imagining it as "the perfect job."

{% include feature/youtube-embed.html youtubeid="6twwXQH40Lg" start="71" %}

Every self-respecting video store featured a small television, usually by the counter, that played movies while customers browsed. At Howard Hughes, staff decided what to screen, often choosing the same movies again and again. "Certain employees would have their favorites, you know. You’d just walk in, you’d see something playing and be like, "{% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="Oh, so and so’s working" objectid="mainstreet003" start="1004" %},” says Beau Newsome.

They stayed away from picks with swearing, gore, and nudity, but that doesn’t mean there was never controversy. [Benjamin Hardcastle]({{ '/items/mainstreet007.html' | relative_url }}) remembers when they were {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="written up in the paper" objectid="mainstreet007" start="2500" %} over the outrage that they played [*The Cable Guy* (1996)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhhI_qYOacw){:target='_blank'} in the store.

There was also a young customer who was afraid of the Gollum character from _Lord of the Rings_, so they would {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="switch to a different movie" objectid="mainstreet007" start="2500" %} if it was playing when she stopped in.

Staff had the privilege to display their “employee picks,” where each staff member could showcase their personal favorites within the store’s vast collection. Customers often found that one employee was especially aligned with their taste and grew to trust their recommendations. 

When customer [Bekah Miller MacPhee]({{ '/items/mainstreet004.html' | relative_url }}) saw a movie she loved as an employee pick, “I’d think, {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="Oh my gosh, I have a kinship with this person" objectid="mainstreet004" start="697" %},"(though generally things didn’t go as far as in [that one *Seinfeld* episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDwJSX8suEQ){:target='_blank'}.)

The staff had a contest amongst themselves to see whose picks would be the most rented during a given stretch—Connor O’Rourke was the winner all but once, {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="at least, according to Connor himself" objectid="mainstreet031" start="1349" %}.

Even if your taste _didn’t_ magically align with an employee’s, they worked to get to know what you liked and recommend accordingly. [Lily Pannkuk]({{ '/items/mainstreet015.html' | relative_url }}) describes how when regular customers came in, "employees who knew them well could say, {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="‘Hey, I just got in a new movie, and when I saw the cover, I thought of you.’" objectid="mainstreet015" start="1671" %}

If they led you astray too many times, {% include feature/youtube-clip-modal.html text="you might even get a free rental out of the deal." objectid="mainstreet031" start="1563" %}

Howard Hughes was a place for staff and customers to share their love of movies in both big and small ways. Lily loved the quiet moments in the store, standing with customers and watching whatever was playing on the monitor. 

As Ben puts it, "I felt like it was an honorable profession to give people entertainment."
