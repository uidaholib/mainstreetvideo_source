***Remarks made on the last of three Wednesday evenings of a sponsored film series at the Kenworthy Theatre in Moscow.***

Thanks to the Moscow Film Society and the University of Idaho Library for holding this firm series with a tribute to Howard Hughes Video, eventually known as Main Street Video Coop.

There’s an aspect of coming full circle to be standing here talking about the video rental store.  Americans first watched movies in theaters exactly like this one, literally here in the Kenworthy, which is approaching its centennial.  Thank you, Kenworthy, for keeping going and for maintaining a place for communal watching of movies.

People my age watched a lot of movies on TV.  They were interrupted by commercials, and were played when the networks decided to play them.  If you missed them, you missed them.

It was huge when VCRs came in, and we could tape shows and movies.  The visuals and the sound were less good than at the theater, but we had control over when we watched programs.  And from that was born the video rental business.

I extend my great appreciation to the University of Idaho Library Special Collections for realizing that the video rental store was a cultural phenomenon which needed to be preserved for history.  

I was honored and delighted to serve as one of the interviewers for the oral history portion of the Library’s preservation work.  I conducted over twenty interviews from my own dining room, during the pandemic, using Zoom.  It was moving to hear how much the video store affected and inspired people of all ages here in Moscow.  

Common themes emerged from the interviews:  

* Customers loved the tactile sense of the place – the way the movies were organized, wandering around in the aisles, touching the boxes and reading them.   
    
* Customers loved the social aspects of the place – the incredibly knowledgeable store personnel, the chatter with other customers, simply bumping into friends and getting into conversation

* The selection was huge – 35K titles\!  When we contemplate the many, many streaming services nowadays, oh my, the video store was a great deal –  
    
  *  99 cent night; 5 movies, 5 nights,5 dollars; eventually 5 movies, 5 nights; 7 dollars  
  * Compare that with all the services costing from $10-30 a month  
    * unless you play, and inevitably lose, the “get three months free” game (so maddening to wind up paying something\!) 

* My strongest impression of what emerged in the interviews was that the watching of rented videos was often a family affair\!  An event\!

  * First the trip to the store and the lengthy, sometimes tear-filled, debates about what to watch

  * Then sitting down together, popcorn made, bathroom runs finished, to watch

  * Yes, lots of talking during the movie, 

    * debating “where do we know that actor from?”  
    * lots of starting and stopping,   
    * lots of asking that a scene be repeated “what did they say again?”     
    * (Training us in habits that the Kenworthy is trying to break us from indulging here in the theatre, but at home, yes, it is part of the fun\!)  
        
  * Then discussing it afterwards  
      
  * Then watching (and settling arguments) by watching the “making of” segments following the movies


* ALL this done, often, cuddling under a blanket with loved ones 

I had thought I was the only one sappy enough to get weepy when thinking about watching rented videos together with my loved ones, but several of my interviewees were moved to tears when remembering family times watching

It was such a privilege to speak with folks about the video store – and get some excellent movie tips along the way.  I hope you’ll choose to listen in to our conversations by accessing them on the UI website.  I’m so glad this history was preserved.

Enjoy the movie tonight!
