***Boycotting Howard Hughes***

*by Sarah Nelson*

Tim (and I, truth be told) boycotted Howard Hughes Video for several—many??—years ​after the lovely June evening, who knows in what year exactly, when Tim stopped into the Howard Hughes store located on the corner of Washington and 5th St. to return a VHS tape we'd rented. I don't remember what movie it was.

We had rented it at 8 pm the night before. Tim was returning it at 7 pm.

The guy working the cash register said he would need to charge Tim for another day's rental, since the return time was 6 pm.

Tim said, come on—we haven't even had it for 24 hours, and it's the summer, and there's nobody around. Certainly, they didn't have a wait list for this ​movie.

The guy said sorry, he already entered the charge in the register, and he couldn't change it.

Tim said that's ridiculous and grudgingly paid the charge.

He was turning to go when he had a thought. He said, "Wait! If I've rented it for another day, then I want it—let me take it back."

The guy said, "Well, OK. But I have to go in and change it so it doesn't say it's been returned."

Tim: "So you CAN change it?!!"

... And that's how our boycott began. We agreed that dammit! if you're a little local video store, you should specialize in customer service, if you wanted to compete with Blockbuster and Hastings and the other chains. 

We also agreed that Howard Hughes employees had a habit of treating us with open disdain, no matter what we rented or how agreeable we were. It seemed important to them that we understand we were not cool, and they were.

That's my story, and I'm sticking to it!
